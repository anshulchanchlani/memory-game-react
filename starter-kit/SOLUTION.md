# Schmemory Solution - 3 hours timebound.

1. I have written my own webpack configuration for dev and prod.
2. I have focussed on the game play engine, showing and matching of cards and also a best time and timer for the app as features.
3. I have written basic test cases for few of the components but due to lack of time, this is something I'd like to heavily add in future, given more time.
4. Run ``` npm run build ```. This should create a production build which is minimzed and optimized. This would create a dist folder containing index.html.
5. Run example-image-server in bash and launch index.html and enjoy the game :)
6. I have tried to be descriptive in variable/function names and also have given comments at necessary places.
